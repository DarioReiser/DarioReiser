# 👋 Hello, I'm Dário Augusto Reiser!  

**🌍 Swiss Mozambican | 🇲🇿 Born in Pemba, Mozambique | 🌍 Currently Exploring the Digital Frontier**  

## 🎯 About Me  
I'm a **22-year-old self-taught Web Developer** with a passion for crafting beautiful, functional web experiences. My journey began in high school in South Africa, where I first dabbled in HTML and CSS. Though my start was humble (centering divs, anyone? 😅), I quickly discovered a love for building websites and solving complex problems.  

Since 2021, I've pushed myself to learn, grow, and overcome challenges—including navigating citizenship hurdles, mastering a new language (German 🇩🇪), and even recovering from a severe injury. Despite all this, I’ve built **8 personal portfolio projects** and contributed to **8 real-world projects** for clients ranging from small businesses to well-known companies.  

I’m resourceful, self-motivated, and obsessed with improving the user experience. My goal? To go from a frontend powerhouse to a **full-stack developer** and dive into exciting areas like **3D web, AR/VR, and AI**.
