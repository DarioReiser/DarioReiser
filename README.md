## 🎯 About Me  

I’m a 22-year-old self-taught Frontend Developer with an inspiring journey filled with resilience, resourcefulness, and relentless curiosity. My love for web development began in high school in South Africa when I switched from Art to Computer Applications Technology (CAT) in Grade 11, which I admit was a little late, but I managed to power through.

Though my first steps in HTML and CSS were basic (think centering divs and styling a simple button😄), I discovered a deep passion for coding. After high school, in 2021, I decided to take it seriously. Despite facing interruptions from citizenship applications, relocations, and personal setbacks, I persevered and honed my skills.

One highlight was building James Urban Bees, where I implemented advanced JavaScript features like dark mode, live search and dynamic menus, all while barely understanding JavaScript at the time, and this was before ChatGPT was even a thing! I didn't even know how to work with variables properly! So it's safe to say my resourcefulness and determination have been and will always be my greatest allies.

In 2022, I faced my biggest challenge yet: a complete distal tendon rupture (a.k.a. the infamous bicep tear, something only 0.0012% of people worldwide will ever experience). Surgery complications caused nerve damage, and I couldn’t move my hand for 4 months. Thankfully, through rehabilitation, I regained full movement of my arm, hand, and individual fingers after 6 to 7 months. Through grit and determination, I relearned to use my hand and finally got back to coding in mid-2023.

Now, I’m stronger than ever, mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, while expanding my expertise into React.js, Node.js, and 3D web technologies.

My aspiration is to become a Full Stack Developer, creating incredible 3D websites and immersive 3D web experiences, as well as building full-stack web apps and PWAs. In the future, I also hope to explore AI, Robotics Software and LLMs.
