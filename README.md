## 🎯 About Me  

I’m a **22-year-old self-taught Frontend Developer** with an inspiring journey filled with resilience, resourcefulness, and relentless curiosity. My love for web development began in high school in South Africa when I switched from Art to **Computer Applications Technology (CAT)** in Grade 11 which i admit was a little late but I managed to power through.  

Though my first steps in HTML and CSS were basic (think centering divs and styling a simple button😄), I discovered a deep passion for coding. After high school, in 2021, I decided to take it seriously. Despite facing interruptions from citizenship applications, relocations, and personal setbacks, I persevered and honed my skills.  

One highlight was building [**James Urban Bees**](https://james-urban-bees.netlify.app/), where I implemented advanced JavaScript features like dark mode, live search, and dynamic menus all while barely understanding JavaScript at the time and this was before ChatGPT was even a thing! I didn't even know how to work with variables properly! So it's safe to say my resourcefulness and determination have been and will always be my greatest allies.  

In 2022, I faced my biggest challenge yet a **complete distal tendon rupture** (a.k.a. the infamous bicep tear, something only 0.0012% of people worldwide will ever experience). Surgery complications caused nerve damage, and I couldn’t move my hand for 4 months. Thankfully, through rehabilitation, I regained full movement of my arm, hand, and individual fingers after 6 to 7 months. Through grit and determination, I relearned to use my hand and finally got back to coding in mid-2023.  

Now, I’m stronger than ever, mastering **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and more, while expanding my expertise into **React.js, Node.js**, and **3D web technologies**.
