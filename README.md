## 🎯 About Me  

I’m a 23-year-old self-taught Frontend Developer with a journey defined by resilience, resourcefulness, and curiosity. My passion for coding began in 2019 during high school in South Africa when I switched from Art to Computer Applications Technology (CAT) in Grade 11. Despite starting late, I quickly developed a love for web development, beginning with foundational HTML and CSS.

After high school in 2021, I committed to mastering web development, navigating interruptions like citizenship applications, relocations, and personal setbacks. One standout project was James Urban Bees, a personal portfolio project where I implemented features like dark mode, live search, and dynamic menus. Despite very limited JavaScript knowledge, I successfully implemented the desired features. My determination and problem-solving have always been my greatest strengths.

In 2022, I faced my toughest challenge. A complete bicep tendon rupture. Surgery complications left me unable to move my hand for 4 months. Through intensive rehabilitation, I regained full movement and returned to coding in mid-2023, stronger than ever.

Today, I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and expanding into React.js, Node.js, and 3D web technologies. My goal is to become a Full Stack Developer, building immersive 3D experiences and full-stack applications as well as PWAs.
